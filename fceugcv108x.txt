-=[ Usage - Preparation ]=-
 
You can either put FCEU GC onto a DVD with various ROM files or inject the ROM(s) into
the emulator. Either way FCEU GC comes without a ROM file in it and you must first
inject one before you can burn a disc. I would suggest if you're using a SoftMod to 
inject the ROM(s) and create many DOL files as it will cut down on the swapping of 
discs. Note that the ROMS must be unzipped and be in the iNES format (.NES)
 
  -[ Injecting the ROM ]-
 
      These instructions are for Windows users and if you're running Linux I'm sure
      you wont even need most of these instructions and can figure out how to work
      it yourself.
 
      (a) Extract the FCEUGCv108.ZIP and ROMS archives into "C:\NES"
      (a) Goto the Start Menu and pick "RUN" then type in "CMD"
      (b) Type in "C:\" then press ENTER (Changes to the "C" drive)
      (c) Type in "CD\NES" then press ENTER (Changes to the "C:\NES" Folder)
      (d) Type in "DIR" then press ENTER (Lists all the files in the Folder)
      (e) Type in "FCEUINJECT (rom_name.nes) (output_name.dol)" and press ENTER
          Example - "FCEUINJECT Tetris.nes Tetris.dol"
      (f) Put the Tetris.dol (or whatever you named it) on the media you use for
          SoftMod Booting (SD Card, DVD, etc)
 
      If you're going to be creating a DVD for use with ModChips were you can use
      the DVD loading selection menu then you'll only need to create ONE .DOL file,
      but if you're using a softmod you may want to create more then one .DOL file.
 
  -[ Creating the DVD ]-
 
      (a) Load Nero Burning ROM and pick NEW then DVD then DVD-ROM (ISO)
      (b) Make sure Multi-Session is set to NO
      (c) Under the ISO tab set these following options:
          File system: ISO 9660 Only or ISO 9660 + Joliet
          File name length (ISO): Max. of 31 chars (Level 2)
          Character set (ISO): ISO 9660 (Standard ISO CD-ROM)
          Relax Restrictions: Check all except "Do not add the ';1' ISO file"
      (d) Under the Label TAB enter in the DVD name (anything you want)
      (e) Click the NEW button
      (f) Put the ROMNAME.DOL*** file in the main directory (under the little CD)
      (g) Right Click in the DVD Window and pick "Create Folder"
    **(h) Make a Folder named "A", "B", "C", etc
      (i) Drag and Drop the .NES roms into the main dir or **folders
      (j) Pick "Recorder" then "Burn Compilation"
      (k) Pick your speed and make sure to pick "Finalize DVD"
          If "Finalize DVD" is grayed out don't worry
      (l) Hit burn and wait a while
 
     * = You can chose ISO9660 by itself or with Joliet and it doesn't matter
         if you're using a Viper GC or other solution
    ** = Creating folders based on filenames makes for easier loading if you
         have a bunch of roms on the DVD
   *** = This is the DOL file you make with the injection method
 
-=[ Usage - Emulator ]=-
 
To load the FCEUGC.DOL or any other DOL file(s) you've put NES roms into please
refer to the Mod That Cube -FAQ- (http://modthatcube.pxn-os.com) to see how to load
DOL files using your SoftMod and/or Modchip.
 
Once you load FCEU GC the ROM injected into the emulator will automatically load so
you can play it. If you would like to load another ROM you're going to have to access
the "Configuration Menu" by pressing "Z" on the GameCube controller.
 
-=[ Usage - Controls ]=-
 
  Analog   = UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT
  D-PAD    = UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT
  Select   = X
  Start    = START / PAUSE
  A Button = A
  B Button = B 
 
  Z Button = Configuration Menu
  L & R    = Return to SDLOAD (SDLoad Users Only)
 
-=[ Usage - Configuration Menu ]=-
 
  To access the Configuration Menu simply press "Z" while the emulator is running. 
  To access any of the options press "A" and to press the B button to "Quick Exit"
  the current sub-menu you may be in.
