Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

apps			Contains Homebrew Channel ready files
				(see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
				
gamecube		Contains GameCube DOL file (not required for Wii)
				
fceugx			Contains the directory structure required for storing
				roms and saves (see below)

------------------------------
Loading / Running the Emulator:
------------------------------

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew
Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps 
folder included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the fceugx directory structure required. See above.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
---------
You can load FCEUGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with FCEUGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that.

----------------------------
ROMS, Preferences, and Saves:
----------------------------

By default, roms are loaded from "fceugx/roms/" and saves / preferences are 
stored in "fceugx/saves/".

Wii
----------
On the Wii, you can load roms from SD card (Front SD or SD Gecko), USB, DVD,
or SMB share. Note that if you are using the Homebrew Channel, to load from 
USB, DVD, or SMB you will first have to load FCEUGX from SD, and then set 
your load method preference. To load roms from a Windows network share (SMB) 
you will have to edit FCEUGX.xml on your SD card with your network settings, 
or edit fceuconfig.cpp from the source code and compile. If you edit and compile 
the source, you can use wiiload and the Homebrew Channel to load and play 
FCEUGX completely over the network, without needing an SD card.

Gamecube
------------
You can load roms from DVD or SD card. If you create a bootable 
DVD of FCEUGX you can put roms on the same DVD. You may save preferences and
game data to SD or Memory Card.

-=[ Famicom Disk System (FDS) ]=-

FCE Ultra GX supports loading FDS games. The FDS BIOS is required - put it 
in your roms folder, and name it disksys.rom (should be 8 KB in size).
You can switch disks using the A button (by default). The mapped button
can be changed under Controller Configuration ('Special' button).
Compatibility is limited, so check that the game in question works on 
FCE Ultra 0.98.12 for Windows before asking for help. 

-=[ Supported Mappers ]=-
 
Mappers are the way the Nintendo handles switching from ROM/VROM so the more
that are supported the more games will work.
