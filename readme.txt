Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

apps			Contains Homebrew Channel ready files
				(see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
				
executables		Contains Gamecube / Wii DOL files
				(for loading from other methods)
				
fceu			Contains the directory structure required for storing
				roms and saves (see below)

----------------------------
Directory Structure Setup
----------------------------

By default, roms are loaded from "fceugx/roms/" and saves / preferences are 
stored in "fceugx/saves/".
Therefore you should have the following folder structure at the root
of your load device (SD/USB/SMB):

  fceugx/
       roms/
       saves/
       cheats/
       
----------------------------
ROMS, Preferences, and Saves:
----------------------------

Wii
----------
On the Wii, you can load roms from SD card (Front SD or SD Gecko), USB, DVD,
or SMB share. Note that if you are using the Homebrew Channel, to load from 
USB, DVD, or SMB you will first have to load FCEUGX from SD, and then set 
your load method preference. To load roms from a Windows network share (SMB) 
you will have to edit FCEUGX.xml on your SD card with your network settings, 
or edit fceuconfig.cpp from the source code and compile. If you edit and compile 
the source, you can use wiiload and the Homebrew Channel to load and play 
FCEUGX completely over the network, without needing an SD card.

Gamecube
------------
You can load roms from DVD or SD card. If you create a bootable 
DVD of FCEUGX you can put roms on the same DVD. You may save preferences and
game data to SD or Memory Card.

------------------------------
Loading / Running the Emulator:
------------------------------

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew
Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder
included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the fceugx directory structure required. See above.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
---------
You can load FCEUGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with FCEUGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that. A good source for information 
on these topics is the tehskeen forums: http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/

-=[ Supported Mappers ]=-
 
Mappers are the way the Nintendo handles switching from ROM/VROM so the more
that are supported the more games will work.

What's new [20080331]

+[Askot]
- Fixed/changed SDCARD slot selection for searching roms, at 
  start you will be prompted for this option.
- Code cleanup.

+[dsbomb]
- Added Wii mode support.
- Give a "Bad cartridge" error instead of locking up.
- Joystick fixes due to libogc r14's changed stick values
- Rearranged menu to make more sense, and consistent with Snes9x
- Add "Reboot" menu option
- Removed "." directory from SD card listing, it's pointless
- Expand DVD reading to DVD9 size (once DVDs are working again)
- Added option to go back a menu by pressing B.

What's new? Askot [20080326]
- Added saving state in SD Card (State files will be saved in root of SDCARD).
  *Note: I can't make it work to save in root:\fceu\saves, so help needed.
- Added SDCARD slot selection for searching roms, meaning, you can search roms 
  from SDCARD SLOT A & SLOT B (Beta, meaning, buggy, but works).
- For standarization, you must create folders root:\fceu\roms to read NES 
  roms files from SDCARD.
- Added C-Left to call Menu.
- Reading files from SD Card it's faster, now they're called from cache
  after first reading.
- Menu in saving STATE file changed to choose SLOT, DEVICE, Save STATE, 
  Load STATE, Return to previous. 
- Added option PSO/SD Reload to menu, still works (START+B+X)
- Modified controls when going into the rom selection menu (DVD or 
  SDCARD):
  + Use B to quit selection list.
  + Use L/R triggrers or Pad Left/Right to go down/up one full page.
- Some menu rearrangment and a little of sourcecode cleanup: 
  + Everytime you pressed B button on any option, playgame started, not anymore
  until you select Play Game option.

- Wii support (PAL50 fix, 1.35GiB restriction removed)
- 7zip ROM loading support from the DVD (not from a SD card!!)
- dvd_read fix (the read data was always copied to readbuffer instead of *dst)
- slower file selection when using the D-Pad (I didn't like the selection to go 
as fast as in the latest release)
